        <h1>Claude Code Tutorial</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A beginner's guide for the Conservative AI Policy Fellowship</p>

        <h2>What is Claude Code?</h2>
        <p>
            Claude Code is a command-line tool that lets you work with Claude AI directly in your terminal.
            You describe what you want to build or fix, and Claude writes the code, creates files, and runs
            commands for you. Think of it as having a coding assistant that can actually do things on your
            computer, not just give advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need to know how to code to use it. You just need to be able to describe what you want.
        </p>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to install Claude Code on your Mac. If you get stuck, don't worry—that's normal! Just describe the error to Claude once you're set up.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">1</div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <h3>Open Terminal</h3>
                <p>Press <strong>Command + Space</strong> to open Spotlight, type <strong>Terminal</strong>, and press Enter.</p>
                <div class="visual-placeholder">
                    Your screen will show a window with a blinking cursor. This is the Terminal—where you'll type commands.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">2</div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <h3>Check if Node.js is installed</h3>
                <p>Copy and paste this command into Terminal, then press Enter:</p>
                <div class="code-block">node --version</div>
                <p>If you see a version number (like <span class="code-inline">v20.10.0</span>), skip to Step 4. If you see "command not found," continue to Step 3.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">3</div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <h3>Install Node.js (if needed)</h3>
                <p>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a> and click the big green button that says <strong>LTS</strong> (Long Term Support). Download and run the installer, clicking "Continue" through each step.</p>
                <p>After installation, <strong>close Terminal completely</strong> (Command + Q) and reopen it. Then run <span class="code-inline">node --version</span> again to confirm it worked.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">4</div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <h3>Install Claude Code</h3>
                <p>Copy and paste this command into Terminal:</p>
                <div class="code-block">npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code</div>
                <p>Wait for it to finish. You'll see some text scroll by—that's normal. When you see your cursor blinking on a new line, it's done.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <div class="step-number">5</div>
            <div class="step-content">
                <h3>Start Claude Code</h3>
                <p>Navigate to a folder where you want to work (or create a new one), then type:</p>
                <div class="code-block">claude</div>
                <p>The first time you run this, it will ask you to log in with your Anthropic account. Follow the prompts in your browser.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Tip: Creating a project folder</strong>
            If you want to create a new folder for your project, use these commands:
            <div class="code-block">mkdir my-project<br>cd my-project<br>claude</div>
            This creates a folder called "my-project," moves into it, and starts Claude.
        </div>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Your First Command</h2>
        <p>Once Claude Code is running, you'll see a prompt where you can type. Try something simple:</p>
        <div class="code-block">Create a file called hello.txt that says "Hello from Claude Code!"</div>
        <p>Claude will create the file for you. You can then open Finder and navigate to your project folder to see it.</p>

        <p>Here are a few more things to try:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"What files are in this folder?"</strong> — Claude will look around and tell you.</li>
            <li><strong>"Create a simple HTML page that says Welcome"</strong> — Claude will write the code and save it.</li>
            <li><strong>"Explain what this project does"</strong> — If you're in an existing codebase, Claude will analyze it.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Starter Project Ideas</h2>
        <p>If you don't immediately think of a software-shaped problem in your life, I recommend picking a <strong>dead-simple starter project</strong> just to try it out. Here are some ideas for things to ask Claude:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turn a CSV into a report</strong> with charts, plots, and insights. You could use some actual data you have, or try exporting your Goodreads data, Substack data, etc instead. Suggest edits, then save the report as a PDF.</li>

            <li><strong>Make a static website.</strong> This can be a personal website, an informational page, a gallery of images, or something else. For example, you can draft your website content in Google Docs, export it as a Markdown file (easy for Claude to read), and then tell Claude to convert it into a site. Then, play with the design by giving it inspiration images or fonts/colors/vibes. Finally, ask it to help you host it on a free Github account.</li>

            <li><strong>Build a personal tracker app.</strong> Tracker apps are simple and fun to personalize: Claude can make a site for you to log your books, movies, recipes, health stats, journaling, or anything else. Then actually use it, and fix bugs / add features as you go.</li>

            <li><strong>Automate an existing workflow.</strong> Think of a rote task you have to do, e.g. "get transcripts from YouTube videos" or "format a document according to brand guidelines." Explain to Claude what you do manually today, and ask it to write a script to help you automate it for the future. Test and debug until it works.</li>

            <li><strong>Design a custom game for a loved one.</strong> Claude can help you make a simple game like 20 Questions, Wordle, or Brick Breaker (or any other idea). What's fun is customizing the graphics and theme based on someone's unique interests, then building a site to send to them.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be specific about what you want.</strong> Instead of "make it better," say "make the heading larger and add more space between paragraphs."</li>

            <li><strong>It's okay to not understand the code.</strong> You can ask Claude "explain what you just did" or "why did you do it that way?" at any time.</li>

            <li><strong>Iterate and refine.</strong> Your first result won't be perfect. That's fine! Just tell Claude what to change: "make the background blue" or "add a button that does X."</li>

            <li><strong>If something breaks, describe the problem.</strong> Copy and paste any error messages you see. Claude is good at debugging.</li>

            <li><strong>Save your work with Git.</strong> Ask Claude to "initialize a git repository and commit my changes." This creates checkpoints you can return to if something goes wrong.</li>

            <li><strong>Take breaks.</strong> If you're frustrated, step away. The code will still be there when you get back.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Useful commands to know</strong>
            <ul style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <li><span class="code-inline">/help</span> — See all available commands in Claude Code</li>
                <li><span class="code-inline">/clear</span> — Clear the conversation and start fresh</li>
                <li><span class="code-inline">Ctrl + C</span> — Stop Claude if it's running too long</li>
                <li><span class="code-inline">exit</span> — Quit Claude Code and return to normal Terminal</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Getting Help</h2>
